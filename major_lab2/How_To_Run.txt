Major Lab 2

after run 'make program'
start a seperate window for serial communication using: 
screen /dev/cu.usbmodem1411 -f 9600

//  please note, usbmodem number depends on microcontroller
//  if there are issues running "make program" or "screen /dev/cu.usbmodem1411 -f 9600"
//  be sure that in makefile PORT value is adjusted to "PORT=/dev/cu.usbmodemXXXX" 
//  where XXXX is the usbmodem number of current microcontroller


then you can just start typing in the screen 
there are 5 different things need: 
r for reference
c for the period of PD controller
p for Kp value
d for Kd value
g for go(start the experiment)

so for example, you can type
r220
c50
p4
d6
g

This means:
reference position is current position + 220 degree
running the PD controller every 50ms
Kp value: 0.4
Kd value: 0.6


Note: somehow my potentiometer reading is always returning 1, so I didn't use it in this lab, the motor should be hooked up the same way as in lab06
somehow after each run, you need to reset the micro processor then have a new window for serial communication! sorry for the inconvenience!!
