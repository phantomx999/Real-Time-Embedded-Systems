The learning GOAL of this project is for each student to 1) increase his/her knowledge of real-time embedded systems, as well as 2) acquire or improve a skill related to the design, construction, and/or analysis of a real-time embedded system.

**__EVERY student submits an individual write-up, even if the project was completed as a team. All other documents need only 1 submission per team.__**

**__WHO__**: This project can be completed independently or in a team of up to 3 members. The project must scale with team size and each person’s role and learning objectives must be clearly defined.

**__WHY__**: You motivate the work by identifying your learning objectives. A learning OBJECTIVE is a specific skill, attitude, or value that one is attempting to achieve through an activity. The learning OUTCOME is the skill, attitude, or value acquired through the activity [1]. Please consider the following types of learning objectives:
Cognitive objectives: “What do you want to know?”
Affective objectives: “What do you want to think or care about?”
Behavioral objectives: “What do you want to be able to do?”

**__WHAT__**: Primary Deliverables:
- Proposal that, most importantly, identifies learning objectives with respect to the coursework of Real-Time Embedded Systems, as well as describes the final “product.”
- Write-Up detailing both the anticipated and unanticipated learning outcomes with respect to the learning objectives, as well as detailing the effort and product of the project. THIS IS IMPORTANT!
The physical result of your efforts (i.e. the product).

> I appreciate risk-taking that serves the purpose of learning. This is an academic environment and what better place is there to try those things that have unknown results! I am far more interested in what you LEARN than what you produce.


### Hardware Specification

Please fill out the Hardware Requirements Google form (posted in a few weeks).

If you want to keep your creation, then you will need to pay for the supplies of your project. I can help with the sourcing and ordering of components. If you don't want to keep it, I have collected several components over the years that I can lend out, or the Department might pay for additional equipment. Please make reasonable requests for hardware (additional motors, sensors, and possibly a Raspberry Pi), but the availability will be subject to Departmental approval. Anything I or the Department provides must be returned at the end of the semester.

It is not necessary to incorporate the AStar32U4 in your project, but if you choose to purchase and use a different microprocessor, then it is necessary to provide justification in your hardware specification. Alternatively, I have some Pololu Orangutan’s available (https://www.pololu.com/product/1327), which have more processing capability, and a few AStar32U4Primes (https://www.pololu.com/product/3109). There are additional sources in the department that might be available including robots, sensors, cameras, and smart phones.


### Project Proposal

Write a 1 page proposal that outlines your project and learning objectives. This proposal should contain the following information (in a thoughtful, organized manner):
- Project Title
- Short Description
- Team Members
- Detailed Learning Objective for **EACH** Team Member
- Expected challenges of the project (intellectual, mechanical, systems, etc.)
- Background Knowledge/Experience of **EACH** Team Member, relative to the project requirements and learning objectives. There might be a sentence like one of these in your proposal:

  - “I have extensive experience creating microprocessor projects but I have never interfaced one with a mobile device, therefore I will create an RC car that can be remotely controlled with a smart phone.”

  - “I have experience with using sensors but not designing them, therefore I will create a wearable glove that senses orientation of the hand or pose of the fingers using accelerometers.”

  - “I have OS experience but not RTOS, therefore I will install an RTOS and use real-time scheduling for the Positional Control project and compare the results to the non-RTOS version.”

  - “I have very little experience in writing OS services, thus I will create a Real-Time scheduler (kernel) for the AStar32U4.”

  - “I have some experience with manually tuning a PID controller, but nothing very formal. Therefore, I will be conducting a comparative study on different tuning techniques.”

- If there are multiple team members, specify what each person will be working on. I will not accept “We are doing everything together.” Make each person responsible for some aspect of the project.

- Resources: websites, research papers, etc.

### Abstract for Web

EVERY TEAM submits an abstract of their project with title, team members, general description, and learning objectives. Optional images and video may be included.

### Project Write-Up

EVERY STUDENT submits an **__independent__** write-up, even if the project was completed as a team.

>I am far more interested in what you LEARNED than what you produced.

Papers are independent - no shared text except from the project proposal. You can share figures/images.

Papers should be formal to semi-formal, NOT conversational.

- Write a 4-5 page report (1.5 spacing, 1” margins) detailing the learning outcomes of your project, as well as the product. The writing should be of good quality, analytical, and concise, and contain the following information:

  - Introduction and motivation (what might this product be used for or why did you choose this).
  - Learning OUTCOMES (what did you learn?). Describe any technical or intellectual difficulties that you had to overcome. If applicable, discuss how your outcomes were different from your objectives.
  - PRODUCT
    - General description.
    - Figures/pictures if appropriate.
    - Different configurations, if appropriate.
  - Future Work: Based on NEW learning objectives, not yet realized learning objectives, new application, different configuration (hardware or software), …

  - _A TIP_: Find the crossover of your project and course content. You should emphasize those areas related to real-time embedded systems as discussed in class.
